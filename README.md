# force-feedback-steering
A project to create a force feedback steering wheel for PC using the STM32 platform

# Setup
* download and install `STM32CubeIDE` from ST's website (login required, you can use a temporary email if you want to)
    * if you are using a proper email (not temporary), you can skip the repository and patch downloads as this will be done automatically by the IDE when you open the project.
    * if you used a temporary email, you also need to download the STM32F1 repository and the latest patch.
    * extract the STM32F1 repository in `C:\Users\{your-user-name}\STM32Cube\Repository`
    * extract the STM32F1 patch in the same location, when extracting, choose `overwrite existing`
